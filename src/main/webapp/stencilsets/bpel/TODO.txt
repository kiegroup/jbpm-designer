TODOs for the BPEL stencil set:

fromParent
----------
BPEL offers default values of the attributes exitOnStandardFault, suppressJoinFailure.
The default value is the value of the parent's attribute (and "no" in the case of "process").

Bruno's solution: display "fromParent" as value.
Drawback: User does not know, which value "fromParent" actually is.

Solution:
Climb hierarchy tree up and display
no (fromParent) | yes (fromParent)
as value.

(And the drop-down filed has three values. E.g.
no (fromParent)
yes
no
)

invoke is not a structured activity
-----------------------------------
Compensationhandler should not be nested in the invoke
Solution: attached Compensationhandler (e.g. like in BPMN)


onAlarm @ scope may only take a scope as child
----------------------------------------------
That property is not reflected in bpel.json, since onAlarm is used at pick
and at scope.

Possible solution:
Introduce two onAlarms

Drawback: Confusion of the modeler?!
